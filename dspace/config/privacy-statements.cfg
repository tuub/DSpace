1. Personal rights<br/>
I hereby confirm that by submitting personal metadata (name and surname of the participating scientists) I act in consent with all persons whose data I enter. I also confirm that I do not violate any personal rights by omitting the name of any participating scientist.

2. Personal data<br/>
I hereby confirm that the research data submitted to DepositOnce do not infringe any personal rights. All test persons have consented to the data
collection.<br/>If personal data are contained in the research results they are in general completely anonymized according to canonical standards and the test persons
have consented to the publication of the anonymized data.<br/>If personal data are not anonymized the test persons have explicitely consented to the publication of their personal data. All possible insight and re-use of these non-anonymized data by third parties is subject to the requirements of data protection law and requires individual consent by me as
the data provider.

3. Storing of e-mail addresses and names<br/>
In the DepositOnce software, the e-mail address is used as a "unique identifier" for a user account and is linked to the published record. The software also requires the user's first name and last name for the processing routine. E-Mail address, first and last name are not displayed in DepositOnce, but are used solely for internal system processing. I hereby agree that my e-mail address and my first and last name are stored in the DepositOnce system when I submit and publish a record in DepositOnce.
