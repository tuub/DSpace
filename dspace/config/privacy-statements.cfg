1. Personal Rights<br/>
I hereby confirm that by submitting personal metadata (name and surname of the participating scientists) I act in consent with all persons whose data I enter. I also confirm that I do not violate any personal rights by omitting the name of any participating scientist.

2. Anonymization of Personal Data<br/>
I hereby confirm that the research data submitted to DepositOnce do not contain any personal data. If personal data are contained they are completely anonymized according to canonical standards and the human subjects have consented to the data collection as well as to the publication of the (anonymized) data.

3. Storing of E-mail addresses and names<br/>
In the DepositOnce software, the e-mail address is used as a "unique identifier" for a user account and is linked to the published record. The software also requires the user's first name and last name for the processing routine. E-Mail address, first and last name are not displayed in DepositOnce, but are used solely for internal system processing. I hereby agree that my e-mail address and my first and last name are stored in the DepositOnce system when I submit and publish a record in DepositOnce.
